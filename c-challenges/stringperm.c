	Here is another mathematical problem, where the trick is as much to 
discover the algorithm as it is to write the code: write a program to
display all possible permutations of a given input string--if the string
contains duplicate characters, you may have multiple repeated results.
Input should be of the form:
"./permute string"
and output should be a word per line.
Here is a sample for the input cat:
cat
cta
act
atc
tac
tca

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
	
}
