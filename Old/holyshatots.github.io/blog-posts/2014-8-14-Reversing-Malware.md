There are many uses of malware:

- Backdoor access
- DOS attacks
- Vandalism
- Resource Theft
- Information Theft


Malware is a large industry where a lot of money goes. The game between anti-virus creators and malware creators
is an eternal cat-and-mouse game where the anti-virus creators try to catch up to the malware creators. There
are many ways that malware can be hidden from anti-virus like polymorphism and metamorphism.

## Polymorphism

- Anti-viruses identify malicious programs by using unique signatures
- Polymorphism is when programs randomly encrypt and encode program code in a way that it maintains it's
original functionality, but also thwarts signature-based detection.
- There are two weaknesses to polymorphism:
  1. Many antivirus scan for signatures __in memory__ and many times the program will be in its original
unencrypted form
  2. The decryption code has to be present which can be signatured and defeated by anti-virus
- Both of these can be fixed by changing and/or scrambling certain elements of the code so that they keep their
original functionality.

## Metamorphism

- The entire program is altered each time that it is replicated.
- Makes it very hard if not impossible to use signature-based detection.
- Some examples of the ways the metamorphic engine can alther the code:
  1. Instruction and Register Selection
  2. Instruction Ordering
  3. Garbage Insertion
  4. Function Order
