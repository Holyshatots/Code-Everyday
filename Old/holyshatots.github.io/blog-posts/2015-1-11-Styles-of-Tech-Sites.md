Wired writes about various topics from Electronic Gear to Design. Generally the articles are based on
what is seen as currently popular. The articles feature plenty of pictures or videos along with a
pyramid style of writing to keep the most important pieces on top. Most articles feature an interview 
with an expert or witness to get accurate information about the topic. 

## [CNET News](www.cnet.com/news/)

CNET targets an audience that is less technical in general than other technology news sites. It
tends to explain tech terms in simple terms whereas other websites assumes prior knowledge. CNET's posts
are short and to the point. Like all of the other articles, it follows a reverse pyramid structure to keep
the most important information at the top of the article. In comparison to WIRED, there are generally less
photos and videos incorporated into the articles.

## [TechCrunch](techcrunch.com)

TechCrunch focuses on the information technology (IT) companies and technology gadgets. The content of the articles are different
and geared for a more technical audience. A basic background in IT or support is assumed in the articles, although
some terms are still explained. TechCrunch makes good use of hyper linking to other sites. This is a common technique of news 
and blog sites to increase the links between itself and other sites. This can help it rise above other sites in search engine results.

## [Gizmodo](gizmodo.com)

Gizmodo isn't strictly a technology news website. It also features a lot of entertainment news about the latest movie releases 
and information about famous actors and actresses. Any complex vocabulary is avoided in the articles and replaced instead with 
either simple analogies or just being glossed over with no detail. The topics of the posts are often the current top videos or
a new gadget that has been released or announced.

## [Engadget](www.engadget.com)

Engadget is a news site that focuses on new gadgets, science, and current events. The articles are very professional and usually
include an interview, video, and pictures to make reading it more interesting. An average post is longer on Engadget than other
news sites like Gizmodo or CNET News. Engadget also includes things that the other news sites don't always include, tutorials. How-to's 
of various things are created an posted onto Engadget.

## [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)

Hacker news is a website focused on programmers and entrepreneurs. The posts are submitted by the users
and will usually link to an external website. It is run by an investment fund and startup incubator, [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/).
The users that usually post and comment are intelligent and any non-constructive comments are downvoted by the
users. This creates some content trimming that increases the quality of the site dramatically. It is very akin
to Reddit but with one focused community instead of Reddit's diverse set of communities organized into subreddits.

## [New York Times Technology Section](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/technology/index.html)

The New York Times is a respected newspaper with established journalistic credibility. This is reflected in the writing
of the articles in the technology section. They are concise and to the point, delivering the most important information to 
the reader. The topics of the newspaper gone news website vary from laws effecting technology development to recent data
breaches. Relevant images are included in the articles as is common for a news website.
