## [The case of the missing "T"](http://www.ksl.com/?sid=16460735)

Research from David Eddington, a BYU linguistics professor, has shown that young Utah females are 
more prone to a unique pronunciation of the words "mountain", "Layton", and "button". It is a common dialect
in Utah to omit the "T" in various words. This is especially apparent where there is a "N" sound later in the 
word. To gather this information, Eddington gathered 57 volunteers and had them all take a speaking test to determine
the extent of the Utah dialect and the unique characteristics of it. According to Eddington, "Generally if someone had lived
two-thirds of their life in Utah, they were more likely to use (the unusual pronunciation)." (Eddington) This is an example of language
being changed through time. Language is dynamic and how we write and speak change significantly throughout time. "Eddington points out that older people have been complaining about the pronunciation of younger people at almost every point in history." (Hellenhorst)

### Analysis of text

The article makes heavy use of quotation from the author of the study, David Eddington a linguistics professor. There are not many uses of any functional language like metaphor or simile. Since it this is the news, the information is concise and to the point. It follows the structure of many other news stories. It starts off with a thesis sentence that nicely sums up the entire point of the article. Near the end is more humorous with the quotation "We're pretty cool in Utah. It could be possible they want to be like us." The article also comes with a video.
