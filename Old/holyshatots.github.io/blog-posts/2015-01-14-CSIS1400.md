##Building a (dumb) Chatbot.

In the computer programming course at CTEC we made java chatbots to keep us from being lonely. This was the first major 
project for this class and so we had to put in enough effort not to make it look like Windows hotdog stand theme.

There are a couple of different chat features that I implemented into my chatbot like recognition of lord of the rings 
and periwinkle. Originally, there were plans to implement the original alice chatbot into this but due to time constraints, 
did not work out. The implementation of the chat logic is simply a list of if-else statements for simplicity's sake.

## Reflection

This project was mainly focused on learning to use GUI components and the design of a java desktop application. 
The base logic of the chatbot is simple and but not the reason for the project. 
We were able to come up with a layout that doesn't assault the eyes and is still functional. 
This is a useful reference for the basic design of any java desktop application. It uses the MVC structure,
has a GUI, and runs without errors. 

My personal go at the task can be found [here](https://github.com/Holyshatots/Mr-Sir-Chatbot).
