A vocab list for the AP Computer Science test

- abstract : a type of class that cannot be instantiated 
- .add : Add a new object to an arrayList
- algorithm : A defined way to do something 
- argument : An actual parameter in a method call, or one of the values combined by an operator
- array : A simple collection of values of the same primitive type.
- ArrayList : A Java class that implements a dynamically growing array of objects  
- assignment operator : The = places a new value into a variable
- base case : In recursion, it breaks the loop when it is met
- big O notation : a function that describes the worst case of an algorithm
- binary : base 2 numbers
- boolean : A primitive that is only true/false
- cast : Convert from one type of object to another
- catch : Used to catch an error and handle it properly, always after a try block
- char : A primitive type that holds enough for one character 
- child class : A class that inherits from another class
- class : Defines the type of Java object in the source
- comments : What good programmers use to describe why their code is doing things
- .compareTo : Will return a value based on the differences of two objects
- compiling : Converting source code into machine code or some intermediate form
- concatenation : Placing one string after another to form a new string
- conditional operator : Another name for ternary operator will be in the form e1 ? e2 : e3 
- constructor : The method that is called when an object is created
- control structure : The way the program has its controls setup
- de morgan's laws : Rules that allow certain logical statements to be written in a simpler form for use in programs /
circuits
- decrement operator : -- will decrease the variable by 1 
- do-while : A form of a while loop that will execute once before checking the condition
- double : A long digit in java
- encapsulation : The hiding of implementation details
- .equals : Returns based on if the object's are considered equal
- escape sequence : A character in text that is not interpreted literally but has a special meaning like a new line
- exception : An error that is thrown
- extends : Inherits all of the methods and variables of the extended class
- for each loop : A for in the form for(objectType name : array){} that loops through all data members 
- for : A loop that continues until a condition is met
- garbage collection : When objects lose all references to them they are cleaned up from memory automatically 
- getters : Returns data members that are private to an object
- hexadecimal : Numbers in base16
- identifier : The name used to define in Java
- if-else : A block that is dependent on a condition
- implements : Inherits the methods and variables of the implemented class
- import : Import classes into the package
- increment operator : ++ increases a variable by 1
- index : The current position 
- insertion sort : A type of sorting algorithm 
- instance : An object whose type is that class
- int : A whole number primitive
- interface : A group of related methods with empty bodies. These cannot be instantiated
- iteration : Looping through all members of a data structure
- javadoc : The way of documenting in Java that provides readable documentation
- List : A Java class that implements a dynamically growing array of objects
- logical operator : A symbol or word to connect two or more sentences
- main : The entry point into a java program 
- matrix : A way of storing information that is equivalent to an 2D array
- method : A function that has code that is run when the method is called
- method overriding : Implementing a new method from the parent class
- modulus operator : % returns the remainder 
- nested loop : A loop within another loop
- new : Instantiate another instance of an object
- null : Nothing
- object : A representation that has data and can do stuff
- object-oriented programming (oop) : Programming using objects 
- package : A collection of similar classes
- parameter : A variable that must be given a specific value during the execution of a program
- parent class : The class that the child class inherits from
- precedence (order of operations) : The order that the math symbols are computed
- precision : The number of significant figures in a number
- primitive data type : A simple type of data 
- pseudocode : Representation of code that is general and won't actually run
- recursion : See recursion
- relational operator : Tests a relationship between two objects
- .remove : Remove an object from an arrayList
- reserved words : Words that are taken by Java and so cannot be used for certain things
- return : What a method gives back to the caller
- round-off error : An error because information was cut off 
- row : A line in a 2D data structure
- Scanner : Input into the program
- .set : Used to make a variable equal to the argument
- setters : Set private data members
- source code : The original code that the programmer wrote
- static : Once the program is run this never changes 
- String class : A string that is a list of characters
- subclass : A class within another class
- .substring : Take a string from within another string
- super : Execute the method of the parent class in an overriding method
- System.in : Input through the console
- System.out : Output through the console
- top down design : Creating a program from the large level to the specifics
- .toString : Get a representation of an object in a string
- try : Attempt to do something but catch an error if one happens
- type conversion : Convert from one data format to another
- uml : A representation of the classes and their relationships
- while : Loop that continues until a condition is met
- wrapper class : A class that encapsulates another one
