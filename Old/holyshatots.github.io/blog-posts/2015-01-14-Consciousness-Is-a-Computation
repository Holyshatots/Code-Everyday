In a blogpost by Nova Spivack, he makes the claim "The simple act of following instructions 
– which is all a computer can do – never results in actually knowing what those instructions 
mean, or what it is doing. The knowing aspect of mind – the consciousness – is not computable."
While Spivack may think that he is a privileged mind that transcends all logic, everyone else has
to deal with the fact that they are simply the sum total of chemical processes and physics. Consciousness
isn't magic. It is a an illusion that is created by all of the parts of the brain working in tandem. While creating
consciousness isn't easy, the entire evolutionary timeline has led up to this point in intelligence, it isn't impossible.
