With the rise of the Internet and more content being added everyday, the access to knowledge
is greater than at any other time in history. With a few exceptions, anything can be learned
online nowadays. There are many great resources that are used by a huge amount of people for the
purpose of self-education and betterment. 

## Is online the future of education?

With the easily scalable nature of online education it is becoming an increasingly attractive 
opportunity for many people. Internet access is being brought to all corners of the world so the
massive amount of cumulated knowledge can be searched and learned. One problem is that with so much
content, it is difficult to find resources that are the best. However, the resources from the best
teachers can be viewed by a large amount of people to help them get a better understanding of the topic.

One of the reasons that self-education works so well is the *motivation*. During a traditional class room
setting, a student has no reason to want to understand the material other than for getting a letter grade. There
are exceptions, but this is generally true of many students. When somebody decides to learn something on their own,
the drive is all from the person and the material becomes interesting because it is not something that to be forcibly read.
