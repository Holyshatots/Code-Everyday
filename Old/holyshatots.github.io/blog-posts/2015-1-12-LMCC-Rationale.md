This rationale was created to explain the purpose of the posts

- [How online self-education will change the face of public education, for the better.](http://blog.holyshatots.com/2015/01/11/Self-Education.html)
- [The Styles of Technology News Sites](http://blog.holyshatots.com/2015/01/12/Styles-of-Tech-Sites.html)
- [Unique Language in Utah](http://blog.holyshatots.com/2015/01/12/Unique-Language-in-Utah.html)

The task is __linked__ to the learning outcomes because in the article "How online self-education will change the face of public education, for the better." the use of media to inform the general population is examined.
The unique attributes of online education versus a traditional
class room setting are examined and compared. The vast amount of knowledge accumulated on the internet has made it a great
learning resource. The post is __intended to explore__ the ability of a new medium of education to properly inform people. 
This new medium is mass communication and could be said to be mass education. A single teacher can teach millions of 
students with the right computer infrastructure. 
The __nature__ of the task chosen is a blog post on topics relating to the learning objectives in a blog format. 
The __audience__ of the blog a
technical readers likely to be proficient in programming or IT. The __purpose__ of the blog is to provide interesting 
content to the targeted audience as well as useful information with the interesting content. 
I have prior __knowledge__ in the writing of blog posts as well as a technical background of programming and information 
technology. 
The __conventions__ of a blog are to use images as well as to use a upside-down pyramid structure of information. All of the 
important information should be at the top while the more in depth and less necessary information will be at the bottom of 
the post. This is used because readers are not always likely to read through the entire post so putting the most important 
information first will help the reader.
